### Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- Two wires with equal and opposite signals denoted generally as Transmit+, Transmit- /Recieve+, Recieve-
- Twist is important as it keeps a signal wire constantly moving away from the interference
- Opposite signals are compared on the other end
- Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates

### Cable Speeds
- Cables don't have a speed / absolute metric
- The copper supports eletrical signals that are sent over copper cable
- The signal encoding decides the data transfer rate
- A cable must be manufactured to a specific standard(s) i.e IEEE 802.3 determines cable type
- Cable standards are described as a "category" of cable (i.e Category 6, Category 7)
- i.e The minimum cable category for 1000BASE-T is Category 5

### Coaxial Cables
- Two or more forms within the cable share a common axis
- #RG-6 used in television / digital cable, allows high-speed over internet

### Twinaxial Cables (aka Twinax)
- Common on 10gb Ethernet and SFP+ cables
- - Full duplex
- Limited to 5 meteres
- Low cost
- Low latency compared to twisted cables


### Plenum space

- Plenum spaces need to be considered for networking as building air circulation is affected
- Ensure heating and conditioning system is setup correctly
- Poor planing can cause smoke, toxic fumes, and fire hazards

### Plenum-rated cables
- Traditional cable jacket (Polyvinyl chloride)
- Fire-rated cable jacket
- Fluoridated ethylene polymer ( #FEP) or Low-Smoke Polyvinyl Chloride ( #PVC)
- Cables generally are not as flexibile
