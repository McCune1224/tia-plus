### Behind the Scenes
- Many networking functions are part of the inftrastructure

### Access to important data
- Anywhere from our network to somehwere else in the network, and vice-versa

### Remote Access
- Secure network communication

### Traffic Management
- Prioritize the important applications

### Protocol Support
- Maintain update and avoid downtimes


### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- #CDN focuses on getting data efficiently from one central point to an end user
- Generally setup in Geographical locations to help get data cross the world easily
- Caches data:
	-  Duplicate data
	- Users can get data from local server instead of original server which could be in another county

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- #vpn Virtual Private Network's ensures secure and private data traversing a public network
- Concentrator /head-end acts as the main connection point
	- Handles high speed encryption and decryption of data
	-  Often integrated into the firewall
- Many different deployment options including:
- Specialized cryptographic hardware
- Software-based cryptography


### Quality of Service (Qos)
- Traffic shaping, packet shaping
- Control flow of data by bandwidth usage or data rates
- Ensures some applications have higher priorities more than others
- #QoS is normally manged on the router, switches, firewall, or dedicated QoS devices

### Time to Live (TTL)
- #ttl decides how long should data be available
- Not all systems or protocols are self-regulating and we often need to manually tell a system when it should stop
- Timer could be based of time of day, # of iterations
- uses include:
	- Drop a packet stuck in a loop (Router A send to Router B, and then Router B send to Router A)
	- Clear a cache
- in #ip  a specific a time to live section for this purpose.
- TTL for MacOS & Linux is 64 hops, Windows is 128
- #dns is often used to for time based TTL's (i.e how long to cache a lookup for a device)
