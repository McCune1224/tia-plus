### Router
- OSI Layer 3
- Routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches". **Layer 2** uses plain switch
- Often connects diverse network types:
	- LAN, WAN, Copper, Fiber

### Network Switch
- OSI Layer 2
- Bridging done in hardware
	- Application-specific integrated Circut #ASIC
-  Forwards traffic based on data link address
- Many ports and fetures including:
	- The core of an enterprise network
	-  Power over Ethernet ( #PoE)
- Multilayer switches also exist, these are on **Layer 3** due to routing functionality

### Firewall
- Filter traffic by port number or application
-  Next Generation Fire Wall #NGFW is able to identify applications traversing the network and decide if it should be allowed or not.
- Traffic encryption (VPN)
- Most firewalls can also act as a router since they are sitting at ingress and egress traffic
- Network Address Translation Network Address Translation #NAT
- Dynamic Routing

IDS & IPS
- Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System
- Watch network traffic for identifying malicious events on the network
- Watches OS, applications ,etc. 
- Common intrusions include Buffer overflows, cross-site scripting

### Load Balancer
- Distributes load of traffic across multiple servers
- Large-scale implementations such was database farms, web server farms utilize load balances
- Able to identify server outages and move the affected server out of the available pool
- Can handle SSL and TCP protocol for servers

### Proxies
- Sits between the users and the external network
- Acts as middle man between end user to the requested server
- Can cache information, access control, url filtering, content scanning

### NAS and SAN
- Network Attached Storage #NAS connects to a shared storage device and gives file-level access
- Storage Area Network #SAN connects via block-level access
- Both require high bandwidth and should be best on an isolated network (ensuring High bandwidth)

### Access Point
- Often on L2 layer
- A wireless router is a router and an access point in a single device
- Access point general runs ethernet which acts as a bridge.
- Extends wired network onto the wireless network

### Wireless LAN Controller
- Single "pane of glass" to manage the infrastructure
- Deploy new AP's
- Preformance and security monitoring
- Configure and deploy changes to all sites
- Reports / analysis on things like AP use
