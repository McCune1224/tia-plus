- Very sepcific subnetting architecture that is long since out of use (not used since 1993)
- Uses subnetm ask based off respective subnet class

### Construction of a Subnet
- The Construction of a subnet requires 4 components:
	- Network Address
		- The first IP address of a subnet
		- Set all host bits to 0 (0 dec)
	- First usable host address
	- Network Broadcast Address
		- The last IP address of a subnet
		- Set all host bits to 1 (255 dec)
	- Last Usable host address
		- One numbere lower than the broadcast address

### Example Subnet calculation

IP Address 10.74.222.11
- Class A Network, which will use the class subnet mask of (255.0.0.0)

| Network | Host        | Action                                                |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.     | 74.222.11   |                                                       |
| 10.     | 0.0.0       | Network Address (Set all host bits to 0)              |
| 10.     | 0.0.1       | First Host Address (Add one to Network Address)       |
| 10.     | 255.255.255 | Broadcast Address (Set all host bits to 1)            |
| 10.     | 255.255.254 | Last Host Address (Subtract 1 from Broadcast Address) |
