### Uses
- On-demand computing power
-  Elasticity
- Scalability
- Multitenacy (many different clients / companies use the same tech making it harmonious)
- All servers are connected with enterprise switches and routers with redundancy
- Migrate 100 physical servers to one physical server with 100 VM's, what to do with the network?

### Network Function Virtualization
- Manage virtual versions with hypervisor
- Same functionality as a physical device (routing, switching, load balancing, firewalls...)
- Quickly and easily deploy network functions
- Many different deployment options (VM, container, fault tolerance, etc)

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- A pool of resources created in the public cloud
- Common to have many vpc's for different applications (web servers, databases, etc)
- Connect to #VPC with a transit gateway (Basically a cloud router)
- VPC's are commonly on different IP subnets
- Connecting to the cloud is often through a VPN
- If you want a #VPC to be able to interface with the #VPC, a Virtual Private Cloud Gateway aka Internet gateway to connect
#### VPC NAT Gateway
- Network Address Translation #NAT
- Private cloud subsets connect to external resources via the NAT
- External resources cannot access the private cloud. It is ideally a one way communication

### Cloud Security
- Firewall for cloud to control inbound and outbound flow
-  L4 port number control (UDP  / TCP) port
- Layer 3 address configuration
	- individual address assignment
	- CIDR block notation
	- IPv4 or IPv6
