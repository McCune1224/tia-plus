### FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - TCP/20, TCP/21
- **TCP/20** (Active Mode Data)
- **TCP/21** (Control)
- Authenticates with a username and password
- List, add, delete, and other file maintenance


### SSH (Secure Shell) - TCP/22
- Text based console communication
-  Encrypted communication link

### SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - TCP/22
- Utilizes same port as #SSH 
- Superset of FTP but with encrypted network communication

### Telnet (Telecommunication Network) - TCP/33
- Console access like #SSH but open air communication
- Very unsecure, do not use now lol

### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - TCP/25, TCP/587
- Server to server email transfer
- Port **TCP/25** is used for plaintext communication (unsecure)
- Port **TCP/587** is used for TLS encrypted communication
- Also used to send mail from a client device to a mail server
- #IMAP and #POP3 used for clients to get mail from a server

### DNS (Domain Name System) - UDP/53, TCP/53
- #FQDN (Fully qualified domain name) is done by DNS
-  General queries are done via **UDP/53**
- If a large transfer of data is needed (one DNS server to another), **TCP/53** is used

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - UDP/67, UDP/68
- Automated configuration of IP Address, subnet mask, and other network configuration options
	- Requires a DHCP server
	- Serve, appliance ,integrated into a SOHO router, etc
- Dynamic / Poooled
	- Ip addresses are assigned in real-time from a pool
	- - Seach system is given a lease, and must renew at set intervals
- DHCP reservation
	- Addresses are assigned by MAC address in this server
	- Quickly manage addresses from one location

### TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) - UDP/69
- Very simple file transfers, (plain read writes that don't need auth)
- #VoIP devices like  deskphones are common usecases
- Useful when starting a system to get configuration and quick transfers

### HTTP/HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (Secure))- TCP/80, TCP/443
- HTTP uses **TCP/80** for plain web server communication
- HTTPS is just a superset that uses **TCP/443** #TLS (Transport Layer Security) or newer #SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data before hitting L7

### NTP (Network Time Protocol) - Switches, routes, firewalls, servers, workstations - UDP/123
- Synchronizes clocks across devices
- Essential for things like log files, authentication, outage details
- Many devices will automatically update throughout the day
- Sub 1ms accuracy on a local network

### SNMP (Simple Network Managment Protocol) - UDP/161
- Gather statistics from network devices
- Query things like how much traffic has hit the device over a time frame (i.e 210,506 bytes in...)
- SNMP traps allow alerts and notifications from network devices. use **UDP/162**
- Different versions of SNMP utilized:
	- v1 - simple structured tables, not encrypted
	- v2 - rich data type enhancements, bulk transfers, not encrypted
	- v3 - Message Integrity, Authentication, Encryption

### LDAP(S) (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Secure)) - TCP/389, TCP/636
- stores and retrieve information in a network directory
- Non-standard implementation of LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) uses **TCP/636**

### SMB (Server Message Block) - 
- Windows uses a special protocol for file sharing, printer sharing, etc
- Refered to often as #CIFS (Common Internet File System)
- Integrated into File Explorer / Windows out the get go
- Modern versions of Windows use **TCP/445** (NetBIOS-less):
	- Direct SMB communication over TCP

### Syslog - UDP/514
- Diverse systems for consolidated logs.
- Usually used in conjuction with a #SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager)

### Databases (SQL) - ...
- MSSQL (Microsoft Structured Query Langauge) uses **TCP/1433**

### RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - TCP/3389
- Clients for Windows, Mac, Linux/Unix, mobile uses

### SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) - TCP/5060, TCP/5061
- Commonly used for VoIP
- Setup and manage VoIP sessions
- Call, ring, play busy signal, hang up
- Extended voice communication (Video Conferences, instant messaging, file transfer, etc)
