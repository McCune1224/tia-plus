### Classless inter-Domain Router (CIDR)
- #cidr was created in 1993 and removed the restrictions made by class subnet masks
-  We refer the network bits assigned /8 /16 /24...
- i.e 192.168.1.44/24 indicates the number bits in the subnetmask (255.255.255.0)
- Note some OS operations expect decimal masks instead of decimal. Not universal
- i.e 255.255.255.0 <-> 11111111.11111111.1111111.00000000 <-> /24
