- Every device needs a unique IP address (192.168.1.165)
- Subnet mask eg 255.255.255.0
	- Used in conjuction with the IP to determine what subnet it's on
	- Generally for determining local vs outside of subnet
- Default Gateway eg 192.168.1.1
	- The router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
	- The default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet
### Special IPv4 Addresses
-  Loopback Address
	- A way to define a local address without nowing an IP
	- Ranges from 127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254
	- i.e ping 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
### Reserved addresses
- Set aside for future use or testing
- 240.0.01 through 254.255.255.254
- All "Class E" Addresses

### Virtual IP Addresses (VIP)
- Not associated with a physical network adapter
- Virtual machine, internal router address

### Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
- A link-local address that can only comuinicate to other local devices
- No forwarding by routers
- IETF has reserverd 169.254.0.1
- First and last 256 addrdsses are reserve (Functional block of 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255)
-Automatically assigned, uses ARP to confirm the address is available / not in use
