### Three-tier Architecture
- Core:
	- The "center" of the network
	-  Web servers, databases, applications
	- Many people need to access this
- Distrivution
	- The middlepoint between the core and users
	- Communication between access switches
	- Manages the path to the end users
- Access:
	- Where the user connect
	- End stations, printers, etc
- Downtown of city = Core
- Highway = connector from downtown to homes (end users)
- Home = End user that communicates / facilitates with core

### Collapsed Core
- A two-tier model
	- Simplify the three-tier architecture
	- A good fit for smaller orgs
- Combine Core and distribution layers
	- Collapse together
- Simpler compared to three-tier, less costly, but not as fault tolerant

### Traffic Flows
- Traffic flows within a data center
	- Important to know where traffic starts and end
- East-West:
	- Traffic between devices in the same data center
	- Relatively fast responses
- North-South:
	- Ingress/Egress to an outside device
	- A different security posture than East-West traffic
