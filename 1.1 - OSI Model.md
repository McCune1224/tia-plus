OSI Model is the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model

## Layer 7 - Application
- The end user / product layer
- #HTTP, #FTP, #DNS, #POP3...


## Layer 6 - Presentation
- Character encoding
- Application encryption ( #SSL, #TLS)
- Often combined with application layer, almost like a filter 
## Layer 5 - Session
- Communication management between devices
- Starting,stopping,ending sessions refer to L5
- Controls protocols, tunneling protocols exist here
## Layer 4 - Transport
- "Post office" layer
- #TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and #UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
## Layer 3 - Network
- "Routing" layer 
- #IP(Internet Protocol) is this layer
- Fragments frames to traverse different networks
- Subnets, routing, ip address issues refer to L3 
- IP Address, Router, Packet
## Layer 2 - Data Link
- The basic network "language"
- Often referred to the switching layer
- Data link control protocols (DLC)
-  #MAC (Media Access Control) Address on Ethernet exists here
- Frame, Extended Unique Identifier ( #EUI-48, #EUI64) Switch
## Layer 1 - Physical Layer
- Signaling, cabling, connections
- Cables, Fiber, signal itself 
- L1 issue = bad cables, etc
