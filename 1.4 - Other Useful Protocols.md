### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- "Texts messaging" for your network
- Utilized by IP, but not used for data transfer
- Devices can request and reply to admin requests (i.e pings)
- Can send messages when things don't go well:
	- network you're attempting to get to is unreachable
	- TTL information on data
### Generic Routing Encapsulation - (GRE)
- The "tunnel" between two endpoints
- Encapsulate traffic inside of IP:
	- Two endpoints appear to be directly connected to each other
	- No built-in encryption #VPN is needed to secure data

### IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)
- Security for OSI Layer 3
- Authentication and encryption for every packet
- Can provide digital signatures for packets (anti-replay integrity)
-  Multi-vendor implementations since very standard
- Two primary protocols used:
	-  Authentication Header ( #AH)
	- Encapsulation Security payload ( #ESP)
- transport mode send the data as encrypted, however the IP headers are not. This allows anyone with access to the headers to know where the data is going
- Tunnel Mode is a superset of transport mode which encrypts the IP Header as well, and adds a new IP Header

### Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
- #IKE allows for both sides of the conversation to agree on the encryption and decryption keys for the duration of the VPN tunnel. This is known as a Security Association (SA)
- PHASE 1:
	- Created new shared key via Diffie-Hellman shared key (uses **UDP/500**)
	- ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and key Management Protocol)
- PHASE 2:
	- Coordinate ciphers and key sizes
	- Negotiate an inbound and outbound SA for #IPSec
	
### Authentication Header (AH)
- hash of the packet and a shared key
- Commonly uses MD5, Sha-1, or SHA-2
- Generally added to the packet header

### Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)
- Commonly uses MD5, Sha-1, or SHA-2
- Uses 3DES or AES for encryption
- Adds a header, a trailer, and integrity check value
