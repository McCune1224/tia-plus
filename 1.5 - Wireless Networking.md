### Wireless Networking (802.11)
- Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee( #IEEE-802)
- Many updates over time:
	- Check with iEEE for the latest
- Wi-Fi trademark will be on almost every device
	-  Wifi alliance handles interoperability testing
	- Modern standards have more marketable names:
	- 802.11ax = Wi-Fi 6

### Popular IEEE Networking Standards
| IEEE Standard | Name          | Frequencies (GHz) | Max theoretical link rate (Mbit/s) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| 8902.11ax     | Wii-Fi 6 / 6e | 2.4 / 5 / 6       | 574-9608                           |
| 802.11be      | Wi-Fi 7       | 2.4 /5 /6         | 1376-46120                         |
### 4G & Long Term Evolution (LTE)
- A "4G" Technology
- Converged standard (GSM and CMA providers)
- Based on GMS and #EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
- Standard supports down rates of 150 Mbit/s
- LTE-A Supports 300 Mbits/s

### 5G
- Firth generation cellular networking launched in 2020
- Significant preformance imrovements:
	- Higher frequencies
	- Eventually 10GB/s
	- Slower speeds from 100-900 mbit/s
- Signifigant IoT Impact
	- bandwidth becomes less ofa constraint
	- Larger data transfers
	- Faster monitoring and notifications
	- Better cloud processing

### Satellite Networking
- Communication to a satellite
- Non-terrestrial communication
- High cost relative to terrestrial networking:
	- 100 Mbit/s down and 5 Mbit/s up
	- Remote sites, difficult to network sites
- Relatively high latency:
	- 250 ms up, 250 ms down
	-  2GHz frequencies can cause line of sight to be lost due to things like rain fade (storms)
