- The most popular networking technology in the world
- Many different type of ethernet:
	- Speeds, cabling, connectors, equipment
- Modern Ethernet uses twisted pair copper or fiber

### IEEE Ethernet Standards
- Created by IEEE 802.3 Committee
- Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( #IEEE)
- All stypes of standards of Ethernet (mainly copper and fiber)

### Deciphering Standards
- 3 general aspects to read for: Speed, Signal, and Media
- Speed:
	-  Number in standard refers to speed generally (i.e 1000 = 1000mbit/s)
		- 10G = 10GB/s
	- BASE (BASEBAND) Indicates a single frequency taking the entire medium
		- Broadband uses many frequencies, sharing the medium
	- Media:
	- T = twisted Pair copper
	- F = Fiber
	- SX = short wavelength light
- Media Type
