- Combination of a Transmitter and a Receiver
- Provides modular interface which allows for best fit choices (Fiber, Copper...)
- Every interface on the switch handle different types of media
- Many different types:
	- Ethernet or Fiber Channel
	- Not compatible with each other

### SFP and SFP+
- Small Form-factor Pluggable ( #SFP)
	- Commonly used to provide 1 Gbit/s fiber
	- 1 Gbit/s RJ45 SFPs also an option
- Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable ( #SFP+)
	- Exactly the same physical size of regular SFP
	- Supports data rates up to 16Git/s
	- Common with 10GB Ethernet

### QSFP
- Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable
- 4-channel SFP = Four 1 Gbit/s = 4 Gbit/s
- QSFP+ is a four-channel SFP+ = Four 10Gbit/s = 40 Gbit /sec
